# Autoencoders
This repository documents my reserach projects as an undergraduate in Dr. Roman Grigoriev's Non-Linear Dynamics and Chaos lab at Georgia Tech.
My main project is applying Autoencoders to the problem of modeling fine structure dynamics in turbulent data. This is an imortant problem because fine structure is both important and extremely expensive to simulate in detail. Autoencoders have proven to be effective in many areas for dimensionality reduction. Reduced dimensional modeling of fine structure in turbulent systems would reduce the computational cost of accurate models.
